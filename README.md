# About
This editor was made to help designers create quests for a system within my Discord RPG Bot (https://github.com/JusticeShultz/RPG_DiscordBot). This software allows designers to create a node graph that makes a dynamic and large scaling quest line with multiple end results available.

# How to install
Under releases, get the latest zip and extract it, run the exe file within that ZIP and start designing.

# How to submit your own quest line
Want to submit your own fan made quests? Visit our home server here and upload it to the general channel! https://discord.gg/jnFfqhm
